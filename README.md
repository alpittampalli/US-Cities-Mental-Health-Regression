# Why Does New Bedford, MA have so much mental illness?: A Regression Analysis

According to the Center for Disease Control's investigation of the 500 largest US cities, New Beford, MA has the highest self-reported mental illness rates in the nation. But why? For this project, I built a linear regression model to first, explain the mental health disparities across US cities more generally. This, so I could use the high leverage features from those models to recommend to New Bedford, specific interventions.

For the full analysis, see the notebook file titled US Cities Mental Health Regression - Master.
